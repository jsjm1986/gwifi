# Schrödinger's Wife

[中文](README.md) | English

A marriage simulation game based on quantum mechanics principles, cleverly incorporating quantum physics concepts into marriage management.

## 🌟 Game Introduction

In this unique simulator, you play as a husband managing your marriage through the lens of quantum mechanics. Your wife's emotional states follow quantum mechanical laws, existing in a superposition of multiple possibilities. Each choice may cause the wave function to collapse, and each observation affects the stability of the entire system.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Quantum Attribute System**: Wife's emotional states (Love, Mood, Trust) manifest as quantum states
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Cannot precisely measure multiple emotional attributes simultaneously
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Different emotional attributes exhibit correlation effects
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Critical choices may lead to state collapse
- **System Stability**: Need to balance observation frequency and system stability

## 🔧 Core Mechanics

### Wave Function Superposition
```
|ψ⟩ = Σ cᵢ|φᵢ⟩
```
Each emotional attribute exists in a superposition of multiple possible states until observed.

### Uncertainty Principle
```
ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2
```
Measuring one attribute increases the uncertainty of others.

### Quantum Entanglement
```
|ψ⟩ = (|↑₁↓₂⟩ - |↓₁↑₂⟩)/√2
```
Attributes are entangled; changes in one affect others.

### Wave Function Collapse
```
P(φᵢ) = |⟨φᵢ|ψ⟩|²
```
Measurement causes state collapse, influenced by system stability.

## 💡 Game Strategies

1. **Observation Strategy**
   - Allocate daily measurements wisely
   - Avoid excessive observation causing system instability
   - Choose optimal measurement timing

2. **Interaction Choices**
   - Understand how choices affect attributes
   - Consider quantum entanglement effects
   - Exercise caution when system stability is low

3. **System Stability**
   - Maintain moderate observation frequency
   - Balance attribute development
   - Utilize positive entanglement effects

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Frontend Framework**: Native JavaScript
- **Quantum System**:
  - `QuantumAttribute.js`: Quantum attribute management
  - `WaveFunction.js`: Wave function state calculation
  - `Wife.js`: Core game logic

  - `achievements.js`: Achievement system

## 🎯 Game Objective

Find balance in quantum marriage: understand your wife's state through observation while avoiding system collapse from excessive measurement. Create a marriage with both the warmth of certainty and the romance of quantum possibilities.
